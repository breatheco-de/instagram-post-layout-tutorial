In this section, you should use flexbox to align the avatar and username to the left and the post options to the right. Make sure everything is well aligned horizontally.

### Instructions üìù

### 1. Edit the HTML file
Inside the `<div class="header-card">`, add these two main elements:  

**a. `span.html-icon`:**
- Create a `<span>` with the class `html-icon`.  
- Inside this `<span>`, include: an `<i>` tag for the HTML5 icon (use the class `fa fa-html5`) and text that contains: `HTML5` and `Rigoberto`.  

**b. `span.menu`:**
- Create another `<span>` with the class `menu`, inside this `<span>` add the menu icon using Font Awesome (use the icon `fa fa-ellipsis-v`).  
- **IMPORTANT**: Make sure the **Font Awesome** library is included in your HTML file. You can do this by adding this link in the `<head>` section:  

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/4.7.0/css/font-awesome.min.css" />
```
       
## Style with CSS

Adjust the design to be clear, tidy, and attractive. Follow these suggestions:

### For `.header-card`:
- Use `display: flex` to organize the elements in a horizontal line.
- Apply `justify-content: space-between` to separate the elements towards the left and right ends.
- Add `align-items: center` to vertically align everything to the center.

### For `.html-icon`:
- Use `display: flex` so that the icon and text are in line.
- Add `gap: 8px` to create a small space between the icon and the text.
- Use `font-size: 24px` to make the icon more visible.
