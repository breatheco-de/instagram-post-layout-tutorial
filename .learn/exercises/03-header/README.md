# `03` Create the post header

Build the header section of your Instagram post.

In this section, you should use flexbox to align the avatar and username to the left and the post options to the right. Make sure everything is well aligned horizontally.

### Instructions üìù

1. In the `index.html` file, inside the `<div class="header-card">`, add these two main elements:

- `div.details-container`: Create a `<div>` with the class `user-details`. Inside this `<div>`, include an `<i>` tag for the "HTML5" icon (use the class `fa fa-html5`).

Then create another `<div>` with the class `user-details` and place the texts "HTML5" and "Rigoberto" inside it. It should look like this:

```html
<div class="details-container">
    <i class="fa fa-html5"></i>
    <div class="user-details">
        <span>HTML5</span>
        <span>Rigoberto</span>
    </div>
</div>
```

- `div.menu`: Below the `div.details-container`, create another `<div>` with the class `menu`, and inside this `<div>`, add the "menu" icon using Font Awesome (use the icon `fa fa-ellipsis-v`).

üí° Make sure the **Font Awesome** library is included in your HTML file. You can do this by adding this link in the `<head>` section:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/4.7.0/css/font-awesome.min.css" />
```

2. **Style with CSS**. Adjust the design to be clear, organized, and attractive. Follow these suggestions:

**For `.header-card`**:
- Use `display: flex` to organize the elements in a horizontal line.
- Apply `justify-content: space-between` so that the elements are separated towards the left and right ends.
- Add `align-items: center` to vertically align everything in the center.
- Don't forget `padding: 10px`.

**For `.details-container`:**
- Use `display: flex` so that the icon and text are in a line.
- Add `gap: 8px` to create a small space between the icon and the text.

**For `.user-details`:**
- Use `display: flex` so that the icon and text are in a line.
- Add `flex-direction: column` so that the elements are placed one below the other.

**As an extra**
- Create selectors for the HTML and ellipsis icons and apply `font-size: 30px` to make both more visible.
- Create a selector for `body` and give it a black background color.
- Create a selector for the `div.card` element and give it a white background color, a width of 35%, and `margin: auto` to center it automatically.
