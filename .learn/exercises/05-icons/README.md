In this step, you will organize the interaction icons in the post body, such as the "like," "comment," "send," and "save" buttons.

## Instructions 📝

- **Organize the positioning of the icons** inside the `div.content-card`. Create a `div.icons` and within it, group the icons into two elements:  
  - **`span.share`**: Contains the "like," "comment," and "send" icons.  
  - **`span.save`**: Contains the "save" icon.

  ```html
    <i class="fa fa-heart"></i>  <!-- Like icon -->
    <i class="fa fa-comment"></i>  <!-- Comment icon -->
    <i class="fa fa-paper-plane"></i>  <!-- Send icon -->
    <i class="fa fa-bookmark"></i>  <!-- Save icon -->
  ```

- **Use flexbox** to align the "like," "comment," and "send" icons to the left, and the "save" icon to the right.
- **Style the icons section** with CSS to ensure proper alignment and spacing, mimicking Instagram’s interface.
