## Instructions 📝

- **Add a div.post-content** right below the closing `div.icons`.
- **Add a <p> tag** inside the `div.post-content` to display the likes text. You can use this example text:

```html
<p>
    Liked by <strong>4GeeksAcademy</strong>, 
    <strong>html5</strong>, 
    <strong>Web</strong> and 
    <strong>100.000 others</strong>
</p>
```
- **Add a second `<p>` tag** for the post description. Use an example paragraph like "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...".
- **Style both sections with CSS:**
    - **Typography**: Use a readable font and an appropriate text size.
    - **Spacing**: Ensure there is enough space between the likes and the description to improve readability.
