# `07` Final Design Review

In this step, you will perform a complete review of the design to ensure it closely resembles the proposed Instagram post image.

## Instructions üìù
**Check the size of the card** assign a width of `35%` to the card.
**Check that the card is centered** if not, apply `margin:auto` to center it.

**Add a background color to the card** the background color should be white.

**Add a background color to the `<body>`** the background color should be black.

**Check that the `<div class="content-card">`** has padding applied to ensure the design looks good.

**Check the size of the image** make sure the main image maintains its proportions and occupies the full width of the container, i.e., `width:100%`.

**Check the text** make sure all texts (username, description, likes) are legible and properly aligned. You may want to style the HTML and Rigoberto text.

Example:

```css
.user-details span{
    font-family: sans-serif;
    font-weight: bold;
}
```
